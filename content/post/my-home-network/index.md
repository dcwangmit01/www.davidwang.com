I spend too much time on my home network infrastructure, but it is too much fun...Â  Components to brag about include:

  * Embedded linux on a wireless access point
  * Vpn concentrator and clients using certificate authentication to route between family member networks
  * Virtual server and multiple virtual guest machines
  * Fully automated backup process for all data
  * Fileserver for nfs and samba filesharing
  * Web servers which run wordpress, mediawiki
  * Reverse proxies

I used the Dia utility to draw a great-looking diagram of my home network. Dia seems to be a great Visio replacement, and it certainly is better than the old Xfig program I used to use years ago.
